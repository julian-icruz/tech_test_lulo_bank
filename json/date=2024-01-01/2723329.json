            "summary": "<p>In the previous life, the sisters Man Zhu and Sha Hua were beautiful and powerful in the divine world. When Man Zhu experienced the disaster, she suffered a counterattack. Sha Hua saved Man Zhu and thus suffered a natural disaster. Man Zhu ignored the pain of her body and went to save Sha Hua. Sha Hua could not see her sister suffering and decided to sacrifice herself. The god was moved by the emotions of the two sisters and decided to give them a chance to meet when the red magic lily bloomed on the other side. But they agreed to \"not recognize each other\" between meetings. Man Zhu waited again and again, and finally saw Sha Hua, who had lost her memory in the world, but at this time, Sha Hua was already a mortal, named Qian Xia, who was the chief constable of the pure evil department. After the appearance of Man Zhu, there was a legend in the bustling Guangling City. There was a place in the city called the Magic Mirror Pavilion. Its owner was a mysterious woman in red. It is said that as long as you have a wish to realize it, she can help you complete it. The price of realizing the wish is to exchange it with her with your \"one thought\", and Qian Xia was also involved in investigating murders, and embarked on a case investigation journey with the beautiful owner Man Zhu.</p>",
